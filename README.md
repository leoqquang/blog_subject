####### This is my Heart experience while I was in Heart.
######## During my time in Heart Program, I had the valuable opportunity to learn form each individual that Sam Connected me with. Every jobshadow experience gave me new insights and allowed me to development, which made the journey both meaningful and inspiring. 
########## In addition to job shadowing, I built my skills through platform like Skillsoft and W3school, where I strengthenthed my knowledge of programming concepts. I was then able to apply what I learned by using VS Code to create my own virtual website -an experience that helped me bridge the gap between theory and practice.
